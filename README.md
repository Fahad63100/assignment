How to Run the Project on Device
- After clone or download the code, before running the project on a device using XCode, please make sure to update the "Code Signing" Team for all available Schemes (Debug, Distribution, Release). 




How to Run the tests and generate Code Coverage Report:
- First open the Test navigator in Xcode’s navigation pane. Then, select the small Run button next to test target name "AssignmentTests" or "AssignmentUITests".

- Now open the Report navigator in Xcode’s navigation pane, and select the Test report from the list. This should open up a list of the tests that were just run and indicate which passed and failed. In this case, they all passed.

-To view code coverage, select the Coverage tab. Xcode will display the overall code coverage for the framework, and we can expand this to get coverage data on individual files and functions.
